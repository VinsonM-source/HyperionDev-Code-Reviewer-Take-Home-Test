The code that you have given me does seem to have an error in the indentation of 
the definition of the groupAnagrams function. This means that it can cause a syntax 
error. Here's the corrected code that I have done for you below:

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
        result = {}
        for i in strs:
            x = "".join(sorted(i))
            if x in result:
                result[x].append(i)
            else:
                result[x] = [i]
        return list(result.values())
ob1 = Solution()
print(ob1.groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]))

In the above code that I have provided for you, this code will bring up a solution 
for grouping anagrams in the given input list strs. It will do this for you by creating 
a dictionary result, this will be where each key will be a sorted string of characters 
from a word in the list and each value will be a list of words that have the
same sorted string. The function will now then then bring back a list of the values that 
are in this dictionary.

As an example that is given above, in the given input list ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", 
"nat", "bat"], the words "eat" and "tea" are anagrams, as are "tan", "nat", and "ate". 
that will now mean taht the function should return the list [['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], 
['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']], which is now the expected output from the examplle.
